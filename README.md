# T2
This is a generic example of FastAPI's incorporation of Jinja2.

On launch, you'll be presented with an html cat button, which will bring you to another page under the "item" route. "Item" has been configured to accept any input following the last forward slash.

On the item page, you'll be presented with a different background, but the same cat. This will bring you back to the main page.
